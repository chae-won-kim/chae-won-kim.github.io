Hi, I'm **Chae Won Kim**.<br><br>
I am currently a Master's student at the Electrical Engineering Department, [Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology] (KAIST) and researching at the [Image and Video Systems Lab], advised by Professor Yong Man Ro. <br><br>

I'm interested in deep learning (specifically in multimodal learning), knitting, boxing. <br>
Check out my [resume] if you're still interested in me!
