I am a Ph.D. student at the Electrical Engineering Department, [Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology] (KAIST) researching at the [Integrated Vision & Language Lab], advised by Professor Yong Man Ro. I'm interested in multimodal learning, especially human multimodal tasks and vision-language models. <br><br>
