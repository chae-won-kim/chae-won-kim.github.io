Today was my first **official** day of the miracle morning challenge. I‚Äôve been waking up early to do basic morning routines, but I was unaware of the life S.A.V.E.R.S mentioned in the [miracle morning book](https://miraclemorning.com/). Now that I finally took the time to finish the book and write down my life purpose and affirmations, I went through the full routine. I actually haven‚Äôt planned out what book I‚Äôm going to read (I thought it could be any book, but it‚Äôs supposed to be a self-development book...), so life S.A.V.E.S for today. Good enough. üòÅ

### Silence
I‚Äôve been practicing meditation for about two weeks now, so this part was easy. I still find it difficult to focus on breathing, because my mind is yet like a popcorn machine üçø popping random thoughts spontaneously.
### Affirmations
I felt good saying them out loud. I know that these sentences won‚Äôt have immediate and conspicuous impact on my life, but I hope one day when I look back, I do become the person that I‚Äôve outlined in the affirmations.
### Visualization
I found myself smiling as I visualized what I wanted to become. I don‚Äôt have a clear goal or dream that I want to achieve yet, so I visualized various versions of my future self. I began with today, moved on to the end of the year, and to the far future. I hope to become extraordinary, and I already feel good about this.
### Exercise
I‚Äôve been doing posture correction stretching ü§∏! Fixing my tilted pelvis would be a miracle indeed...
### Reading
It‚Äôs been replaced with searching for a book to read.
### Scribing
Well, here I am writing this journal!

## Two weeks in
From what I‚Äôve been doing for the past two weeks, waking up early and just catching up on what I always missed - like stretching and reading - was enough to make me feel good about myself during the day. I found it difficult, however, to commit myself during the rest of the day. I would still be wasting time until 6 pm to get off work. I hope adding affirmations and visualization to my routine helps me motivated throughout the day. Let‚Äôs see, shall we?

Two weeks in, and I am already noticing changes. I could never commit to finish reading a book, not to mention the stack of unfinished books in my room. I have finished reading two books so far - _The Miracle Morning: The 6 Habits That Will Transform Your Life Before 8AM_ by the miraculous Hal Elrod and _The Big Picture_ by Douglas Kennedy. I can't wait to see how much reading I'll do for the rest of my life. It may be too early to say, but I've been drinking less, exercising more, stretching daily, and feeling less depressed. 

Stay tuned for my monthly review of my Miracle Morning journey and more miracle tales! √Ä bient√¥t! üôã
